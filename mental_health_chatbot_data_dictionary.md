## 🔍 Notes on Mixed Values

Where participants described multiple values for a single variable (e.g., used chatbot at home and while commuting), a `Mixed` label was applied along with specific details in parentheses:

**Examples:**
- `locationUsed = Mixed (Home + Commuting)`
- `userSubscription = Mixed (Paid ChatGPT + Free Gemini)`
- `socialUse = Alone (private + public)`

This approach preserves detail while maintaining consistent top-level codes.
